### Pitch
Pictum is an application made to manage the loan of the audiovisual equipment on the "Portes du Jura" campus in Montb√©liard.
Indeed each department of the campus has is own audiovisual equipment and his own loan rules. So to it was to make it easier
that Pictum come. We was a team of 4, I was the project lead and the developer of the team.

### Techs
We choose to make it with Laravel and Vue JS. We choose Laravel for the back-end too make easier the development, learn 
to use it and don't have to remake things that already exists. For the front-end, Vue was ideal because it is made for 
making SPA, is simple and has all the functionality we needed : a router, a store, a page system... The UI is made with 
the help of Bootstrap Vue.

### Process
The process of creation of this project start with a lot of meetings, with all the futur actors of the project. Indeed 
we have web application but used by peoples so we need to know the needs, the constraints, the ideas of each of theses. 
Then we make decisions with our customer and start to think about all the aspects of the project : communication, design, 
technique conception... After a validation of all of that by our customer we made visuals for the communication and developed 
the back-end and the two parts of the interface. Indeed we have to do the administration part and the public part of 
the application.
