### Pitch

The 4th semester project of MMI was to make our personal portfolio... so here is mine. I like it but I wanted something new
so I decided to remake it in Nuxt with a new design and some new features.

### Techs

I've chosen to use VueJS because of the components, the router and the store. It makes the life easier for a web developer.
But also to show my skills. And for the content, I've set up a headless Wordpress and use the REST api to get the content in Vue.
It seems the best option to me at this moment (i didn't know nuxt, static site generators and the markdown at this time).
