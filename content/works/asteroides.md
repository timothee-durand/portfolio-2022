### Pitch

Astéroides is a little web application that give the list of asteroids that have passed near earth at the selected date.
At the beginning I wanted to train myself to VueJS. For that I search a cool API to use and when I found that the NASA has
an open API I knew I found what I wanted.

### Process

First, I make a few try to understand how the data was structured, how to authenticate the application, to make a call,
to show random illustration... : I make a prototype. Then I added Vuetify because I wanted to test it. So I integrate all
with Vuetify. Finally, I add the Parallax Effect because I fund it add a cool depth to the design and represent space.
