### Pitch

Perfect Room is a collective project that we made in MMI, in a 3D lesson. Our teacher had asked us to model our perfect
office in 3D, and then to use ThreeJS and add interactions : we must hide something in a hide vault and to put hint to
find the vault and his code. We were a team of two to do this project.

### Techs

All the 3d model was modeled in class, either with our teacher either by ourselves, using 3dsMax. For the web
integration we used ThreeJS.

### Process

To begin we make a map of the room that we want to do with all the elements. Then, we make a huge array with all the 3D
models we have to do, with their dimensions ,the person in charge of modeling and some inspiration's picture to agree on
the style. After we have modeling a lot and show each other our creation to validate them. Finally, we export all in a
Collada File and import it in ThreeJS. Finally, we add all the interactions : drawers that open, books that move, music,
lights... and we do a little adjustments to the initial interface to make it more pretty.
